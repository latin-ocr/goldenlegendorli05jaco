S, Cornelius succeeded to Fabian in the papaey,
and was sent in exile of Decius Caesar‚ and his
clerks with him. And there received letters of
comfort from Cyprian, bishop of Carthage. And

presented to Decius, And when he saw him fast

beaten with plummets of lead, and that he should
be brought to the temple of Mars for to do
sacrifice, or else to have his head smitten off.
And as he was led, a knight prayed him that he
would return to his house because of Sallustia his
wife, which had lain siek five years of the palsy.
