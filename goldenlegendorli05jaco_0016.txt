2 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The thing when his father and mother saw they blessed

Life Of God, and his mother herself nourished and gave

S· Roeke suck to the child, and fed it and committed and

did gladly the other business of a nurse. Which

devout mother fasted twice in the week, and the

blessed child Rocke abstained him twice also,

when his mother fasted in the week, and would

suck his mother but once that day, which was to

all a great wonder, and that day he was gladder,

merrier, and sweeter than the other. And after,

when he came to five years of age, he disposed him

to the works of penance, and was much obedient

to father and mother. And in the twelfth year

of his age he fasted many and divers fastings for

Christ's love. And the more his members grew,

the more the cross, that tofore was spoken of,
appeared larges and more apparent.

In that time the father of S. Rocke was sick
and saw his last end approach, and called to him
his son Rocke, and said: Ο mine only son Rocke,
thou seest well that I shall shortly finish my life3
alway the will of God be fulfilled, and four things,¹
with my lordship and heritage, I leave to thee,
and command thee to accomplish. First, like
as thou hast begun that thou serve busily God.=
Secondly, that thou remember poor people,
widows and orphans. Thirdly, I constitute and2
ordain thee governor and dispenset of all my
treasures, that thou dispend them in charitable
and meek works. And fourthly that, with all
diligence thou haunt and frequent the hospitals o:
sick and poor men. These foresaid things Rocke
promised to his father to fulfil them to his power,
And anon after his father died, whom Rocke
buried honourably, and laid in a sepulture, and ir
the twentieth year of his age he buried also hi:
