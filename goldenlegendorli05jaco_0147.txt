THE GOLDEN LEGEND 133

at Rome the church is hallowed in the honour of The
our Saviour‚ whereas is kept an ampul with the Exasta·

same blood. And there a solemn feast is kept and

tion of
the Holy

done, and there is proved the right great virtue of Cross

the cross, unto the paynims, and to the misbelieved
men in all things. And S. Gregory recordeth in
the third book of his dialogues that when Andrew,
bishop of the city of Fundana, suffered a holy nun
to dwell with him, the fiend the enemy began to
imprint in his heart the beauty of her in such wise
that he thought in his bed wicked and cursed
things. And on a day a Jew came to Rome, and
when he saw that the day failed and he might find
no lodging, he went that night and abode in the
temple of Apollo. And because he doubted of
the sacrilege of the place, howbeit that he had no
faith in the cmss, yet he marked and garnished him
with the sign of the cross. Then at midnight when
he awoke, he saw a company of evil spirits, which
went tofore one like as he had some authority of
puissance above the others by subjection, and then
he saw him sit in the midst among the others, and
began to enquire the causes and deeds of every
each of these evil spirits which obeyed him, and
he would know what evil every each had done.
But Gregory passeth the manner of this vision be-
cause of shortness‚ but we find semblably in the lives
of the F athers that, as a man entered in a temple of
the idols‚ he saw the devil sitting and all his meiny
about him. And one of these wicked spirits came
and adored him, and he demanded of him: From
whence comest thou? And he said: Ι have been
in such a province, and have moved great wars,
and made many tribulations, and have shed much
blood, and am come to tell it to thee. And Satan
said to him: In what time hast thou done this?
