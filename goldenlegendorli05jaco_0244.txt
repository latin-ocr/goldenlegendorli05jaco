230 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Life but this piece of the capon was seen of all the
F ⁰f S,- people as it were fish, and that man was blamed

ranem of all the people, and said that he was mad, and
when he understood it, he was ashamed and de-
manded pardon3 and when this man came again
to his good thought, the flesh returned again to his
own kind and form.

On a time as he sat at the table, and collation
was made of the poverty of the Blessed Virgin
our Lady, anon S. Francis arose and began to
weep and sob sorrowfully, so that his visage was
all wet of tears, and began to eat the remnant of
his bread upon the ground. He would also that
right great reverence should be done to the hands
of priests, to whom was given power to sacre the
blessed sacrament of our Lord. And then he
said oft: If it happed me to meet any saint
coming from heaven, and also a poor priest, 1
would first go kiss the priest's hands, and would
say to the saint: Holy saint, abide a while, for
the hands of this priest have handled the son of
life, and hath performed a thing above humanity.
He was ennobled in his life by many miracles,
for the bread that was brought to him to bless
gave health to many sick men. He converted
the water into wine, of which a sick man anon
tasted and received anon health, and also did
many other miracles. And when his last days

ground, and did do call all the friars that were l
there, and when they were all present he blessed 1
them. And like as our Lord fed his disciples at ¹
supper on Shere-thursday, he gave to each of
them a morsel of bread, and warned them, as he
was wont to do, to give laud to their Maker.
