THE GOLDEN LEGEND 7

which had great husbandry, and had a great family The
and household. This Gotard held many hounds L1fe ⁰f
for hunting, among whom he had one much S· R⁰⁰ke
familiar, which boldly would take bread from the
board. And when Rocke lacked bread, that
bound, by the purveyance of God, brought from
:he lord's board bread unto Rocke. Which thing
when Gotard had advertised oft that he bare so
away the bread, but he wist not to whom ne
whither‚ whereof he marvelled, and so did all his
household. And the next dinner he set a delicate
loaf on the b0ard, which anon the hound by his
new manner took away and bare it to Rocke.
And Gotard followed after and came to the lodge
of S. Rocke, and there beheld how familiarly the
hound delivered the bread to S. Rocke. Then
Gotard reverently saluted the holy man and
approached to him, but S. Rocke, dreading lest
the contagious air of the pestilence might infect
him, said to him: Friend, go from me in good
peace, for the most violent pestilence holdeth me.
Then Gotard went his way and left him, and
returned home, where, by God's grace, he said
thus to himself all still: This poor man whom Ι
have left in the wood and desert, certainly is
the man of God, sith this hound without reason
bringeth to him bread. I therefore, that have
seen him do it, so ought sooner to do it, which
am a christian man. By this holy meditation
Gotard returned to Rocke and said: Holy
pilgrim, I desire to do to thee that thou needest,
and am advised never to leave thee. Then
Rocke thanked God which had sent to him
Gotard, and he informed Gotard busily in the
law of Christ. And when they had been awhile
together the hound brought no more bread.
