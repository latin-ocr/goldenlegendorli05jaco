88 ’ THE 'GO'LDEN ’LE‘G'END

'The great joy and honour, for he had lost them with
S Ῑ-ΰῖθ 0f great sorrow tofore.

'messffli On a night as 116 prayed‚ he had over great
thirst by the false movings of the devil. And hes
ν , ‹, ἓν ᾗ demanded cold water for to drink, and he knew·
well the treachery of the enemy, and when he
held the vessel in which he should drink, he set a¹
platter upon it and shut the devil fast therein, and
he began all the night to howl and bray. And in
the morning the holy man conjured him that, he
that was comen by night to tempt him, by day he

On 3 time, as he by night visited the churches,
as he was accustomed, as he returned home her
heard his clerks brawling and chiding because they¹
would do fornication with women, which anon
entered into the church and prayed for them, and
anon 311 the pricking of temptation went from them,

of the interpretation of his name.

’ Mammertin is said of mamma, which is as much}
to say as a pap, and of tina, that is to say taste‚ for
like as taste that falleth from the pap into the
mouth of the child, and is first nature of blood,:
and after it is converted into the sweetness of
milk, in like wise was he nourished, first in blood,
that is to say in sin, and after, he converted him-¹

selfdamon into the pap of his heart in the sweetness
of od.
