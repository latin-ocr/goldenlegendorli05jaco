126 THE GOLDEN LEGEND Ι

The the mount of Calvary bare no fruit. It was a
Essasta· foul place, for it was the place of the torment
hug? {³¹- of thieves, it was dark, for it was in a dark
t ecrgs} place and without any beauty. It was the tree

of death, for men were put there to death, it
was also the tree of stench, for it was planted}
among the carrions. And after the passion thel
cross was much enhanced, for the vilety was trans· “
ported into preciousness. Of the which the blessedj
S. Andrew saith: O precious Holy Cross, God'
saw thee.‘ His barrenness was turned into fruit,2
as it is said in the Canticles: I shall ascend up
into palm tree, et cetera. His ignobility or un-
worthiness was turned into sublimity and height.
The cross‚ that was torment of thieves, is now¹
borne in front of the emperors, his darkness is
turned into light and clearness; whereof Chryso-
stom saith: The cross and the wounds shall be
more shining than the rays of the sun at the
judgment. His death is converted into perdur-¹
ability of life, whereor it is said in the preface
that, from whence that the death grew, from thence
the life resourded, and the stench is turned into
sweetness‚ Canticorum 1.

This exaltation of the Holy Cross is solemnised
and hallowed solemnly of the church, for the faith
is in it much enhanced. For the year of our
Lord six hundred and fifteen, our Lord suffered
his people much to be tormented by the cruelty of
the paynims. And Cosdroe, king of the Persians,3
subdued to his empire all the realms of the world 35
and he came into Jerusalem and WRSV-{fssardnassdl

but he barewith him the partor the Holy Crossl
that S. Ῑ-Ιςε-ΙηεῑηειἼ had *left-*there And then he!
