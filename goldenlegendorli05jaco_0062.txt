48 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

‚The Augustin. And what befell to him afterward he
kls-eps rehearseth in the book of his Confessions, and³
S· 1)ιὲῗέἓέ saith: When I knew thee first thou beatedst‹]
away the infirmity of my sight, shining in me³
forcibly. And I trembled for dread of good}
love, and I found myself right far from thee in a ³
region of unlikelihood‚ like as Ι heard thy voice}
from heaven on high, saying: I am meat of great-5
ness increased and thou shalt eat me, thou shaltl
not change me in thee as meat of thy fiesh, but}
thou shalt be changed in me. And as hel
rehearseth there, the life of Jesu Christ pleasedl
him much well, but he doubted yet to go in such
distresses‚ but our Lord anon put in his mind that
he should go to Simplician‚ in whom all divine
grace shone, for to refrain his desires, and for to
say to him what manner was convenable to live,
for to go in the way of God in which that other
went. For all that was done displeased him save
the sweetness of God and the beauty of the house
of God, which he loved. And Simplician began
to exhort him, and S. Augustin exhorted himself·
and said: How many children and maidens serve
in the church of God to our Lord: and mayst'
not thou do that they do in themselves and not
in their God? Wherefore tarryest thou? Cast
thyself on him and he shall receive thee and
reward thee. And among these words Victorin'
carne to his mind. Then Simplician was much
glad, and told to him how Victorin was yet a
paynim, and deserved to have a great image to
his likeness in the market of Rome, and how he
ofttimes said that he was a christian man. To
whom Simplician said: I shall not believe it but
if I see thee in the church. And he answered
merrily: The walls make not a man christian.
