THE GOLDEN LEGEND 187

seigniory or prelacy, and the last is taken in his The
pity or ministration. The prelacy in angels is Feast
treble. For angels dominate over spirits angelic, ffiifffiael
and they be said dominations, and they dominate
also over good works, and they be said principates,
and they dominate over devils, and they be said
potestates, and the order and the degrees of their
dignity appeareth in these things. The ministry
of them is threefold. Some standeth in working,
some in teaching, and in teaching, some more and
some less. The first appertaineth to virtues, the
second to archangels, and the third to angels.
The fifth apparition is it which is read in the
History Tripartite. There is a place beside Con-
stantinople whereas sometime the goddess Vesta
was worshipped, but now there is builded a church
in the honour of S. Michael‚ and is named
Michael's place. There a man that was named
Aquiline was taken with a right great fever, moved
of red colour‚ and the physicians gave to him,
so burning in an ague, a drink, which anon
he vomited out at his mouth, and what he ate or
drank always he vomited and casted out, so that he
was nigh dead, and did him to be borne to that
place, and supposed well there to be soon dead or
healed. And then S. Michael appeared to him
and said to him that he should make a confection
of honey and wine and pepper, and whatsomever
he ate he should wet therein, and so should he
have plein health. Which thing he did, and anon
he was delivered from his malady, how well that
after the judgment of the physicians that drink or
medicine was contrary to them that be choleric.
This is had in the History Tripartite.

Seconffly, this solemnity of S. Michael is said
victory, and the victory of S. Michael is manifold.
