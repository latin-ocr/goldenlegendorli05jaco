Lad

of God, and said every day his hours. And he
saw on a night a vision that, he was in judgment
tofore our Lord‚ and our Lord said to them that
were there: What judgment shall we do of this
clerk? devise ye it for I have long suffered him,
and see no sign yet of amendment. Then our
Lord gave upon him sentence of damnaffion, and
all they approved it. Then arose the blessed
Virgin and said to her son: I pray thee, debonair

assuage upon him the sentence of damnation‚ and
that he may live yet, by the grace of me, which is

was there another bishop made, and Theophilus
was against his will put out of his office. Then
he fell in despair, in such wise that he counselled
with a Jew how he should have his office again,
