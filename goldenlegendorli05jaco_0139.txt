3said to her: Take this meat of my hand, I arn
ithy saviour whom thou hast loved with all thy
jthought. And on that day that I descend into
{the earth I shall receive thee. Then on the day
{of the nativity of our Lord, the tormentor was
¹sent to her and he smote off her head.

And after that she appeared to her mother, and
‘said to her that she should follow her on the
‘Sunday after. And when the Sunday came
Claudia put herself to prayer and gave her spirit
to God, and then Prothus and Jacinctus were
drawn to the temple for to do sacrifice, and they
¹by their prayers all to-brake the idol ς and when
they would in no wise do sacrifice, they accom-
plished their martyrdom in suffering their heads
to be smitten off. And suffered death under
Valerianus and Gallus about the year of our Lord
two hundred and fifty-seven, by whose merits let
us pray Almighty God to have mercy on us and
bring us to his bliss. Amen.

Christ, the tree of the cross was a tree of filth‚
for the crosses were made of vile trees and of
trees without fruit, for all that was planted on

 

The

cold. And then she was put into a dark prison, Exasta·
but a great shining light made it all clear and Ποῦ Of
