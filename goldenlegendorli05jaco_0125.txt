THE GOLDEN LEGEND 111

let us continually give laud and praising to her as The. ·
much as we may, and let us say with S. Jerome Natffsty
this response: Sancta et immaculata virginitas. ‘fil-azur
And how this holy response was made, I purpose, y
under correction, to write here. It is so thatI

was at Cologne, and heard rehearsed there by a
noble doctor that, the holy and devout S. J erome had

a custom to visit the churches at Rome. And so

he came into a church where an image of our
blessed Lady stood in a chapel by the door as he
entered, and passed forthby without any salutation

to our Lady, and went forth to every altar and
made his prayers to all the saints in the church‚

each after other, and returned again by the same
image without any saluting to her. Then our
blessed Lady called him and spake to him by the

said image, and demanded of him the cause why

he made no salutation to her, seeing that he had

done honour and worship to all the other saints of
whom the images were in that church. And then

S. Jerome kneeled down and said thus: Sancta et
immaculata virginitas, quibus te laudibus referam
nescio. Quia quem celi capere non poterant, tuo
gremio contulisti. Which is to say: Holy and
undefiled virginity, I wot never what laud and
praisings I shall give to thee. For him that

all the heavens might not take ne contain‚ thou

hast borne in thy womb. So sith this holy

man thought himself insufficient to give to her
laud, then what shall we sinful wretches do but

put us wholly in her mercy, acknowledging us
insufficient to give to her due laud and praising?

But let us meekly beseech her to accept our good
intent and will, and that by her merits we may

attain after this life to come to her in everlasting
life in heaven. Amen
