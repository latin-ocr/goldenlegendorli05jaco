174 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Lives tofore the judge. And when the judge saw them,
Of saints he said: Ye overcome our great gods by your
cozngg enchantments; ye despise the torments and make
Damian the sea peaceable. Teach ye me your witchcraft,
and in the name of the god Adrian, I shall follow
you. And anon as he had said this two devils
came and beat him greatly in the visage, and he
crying said: O ye good men, I pray you that ye
pray for me to our Lord, and they then prayed
for him and anon the devils departed. Then the
judge said: Lo! ye may see how the gods had
indignation against me, because I thought to have
forsaken them, but I shall not suffer my gods to
be blasphemed. And then he commanded them
to be cast into a great fire, but anon the flame
sprang far from them and slew many of them that
stood by. And then they were commanded to be
put on a torment named eculee, but they were
kept by the angel of our Lord, and the tormentors
tormented them above all men, and yet were they
taken off without hurt or grief, and so came all
whole tofore the judge. Then the judge com-
manded the three to be put in prison, and made
Cosmo and Damian to be crucified, and to be .
stoned of the people, but the stones returned to ᾗ
them that threw them, and hurt and wounded
many of them. Then the judge, replenished with
woodness, made the three brethren to stand by the
cross, and commanded that four knights should
shoot arrows to Cosmo and Damian, but the
arrows returned and hurt many, and did no harm
to the martyrs. And when the judge saw that, he
was confused in all things, he was anguishous unto
the death, and did do behead all five brethren

to ether.
