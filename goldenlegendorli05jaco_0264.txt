250 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The enchantment2 ,for thosfraaystflhaply *know „seme
Life 9f words that havesuchmight and-virtue„ And S.
S· Dems Paul said: I shall write tofore the form of the
words, which be these: In the name of Jesu
Christ, born of the virgin, crucified and dead,
which arose again and ascended into heaven, and
from thence shall come for to judge the world:
See. And because that all suspicion be taken
away, Paul said to Denis that he himself should
pronounce the words. And when Denis had said
those words in the same manner to the blind man,
anon the blind man recovered his sight. And
then Denis was baptized and Damaris his wife
and all his meiny,and was a true christi'an‘man
and was instructed and taught by S. Paul three
years, and was ordained bishop of Athens, and
there was in predication, and converted that city,
and great part of the region, to christian faith.
And it is said that S. Paul showed to him that he
saw when he was ravished into the third heaven,
like as S. Denis saith and showeth in divers
places, whereof he speaketh so clearly of the
hierarchies of angels, and of the orders and of
the dispositions and offices of them, so that it is
not supposed that he learned of any other, but only
of him that was ravished into the third heaven,
and had seen all things. He flourished by the
spirit of prophecy like as it appeareth in an epistle
that he sent to John the Evangelist, in the isle of
Patmos, to which he was sent in exile, whereas he
prophesied that he should come again, saying thus:
Enj0y thou verily beloved, very wonderful and to
be desired, right well beloved, ,thou shalt be let
out from the keeping that thou hast inJPatmos,
and shalt return unto the land of Asia, and thou
shalt make there the following of thy good God,
