THE GOLDEN LEGEND 175

that S. Cosmo had said, that his brother should The Lives

not be buried with him, and as they thought 0f saints

thereon there came a voice which cried and said: cogmo
They be all of one substance, bury them all {namian
together in one place. And they suffered death

under Diocletian about the year of our Lord two
hundred and eighty-seven.

It happened that a husbandman after that he
had laboured in the field about reaping of his
corn, he slept with open mouth in the field, and
a serpent entered by his mouth into his body.
Then he awoke and felt nothing, and after returned
into his house. And at even he began to be tor-
mented and cried piteously‚ and called unto his
help the holy saints of God‚ Cosmo and Damian,
and when the pain and anguish increased he went
to the church of the saints, and fell suddenly
asleep, and then the serpent issued out of his
mouth like as it had entered.

There was a man that should have gone a long
voyage, and recommended his wife to Cosmo and
Damian, and left a token with her that, if he sent
for her by that token she should come to him.
And the devil knew well the token‚ and trans-
figured himself in the form of a man, and brought
to the woman the sign of her husband and said:
Thine husband hath sent me from that city to
thee for to lead thee to him. And yet she
doubted for to go with him and said: Ι know
well the token‚ but because he left me in the
keeping of the saints Cosmo and Damian, swear
to me upon their altar that thou shalt bring me to
him surely, and then Ι shall go with thee, and he
sware like as she had said. Then she followed
him. And when she carne in a secret place the
devil would have thrown her down off her horse
