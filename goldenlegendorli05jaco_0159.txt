THE GOLDEN LEGEND 145

she was alone spared tor to be out of bonds. And The Life
then she was long beaten with fists‚ and after, sent ⁰f S· ,
again to prison, and the judge followed her, and EUfem¹a
would have taken her by force for to have
accomplished his foul lust, but she defended her
forcibly‚ and the virtue divine made the hands of
the judge to be lame. And then the judge weened
to have been enchanted, and sent to her the
provost of his house for to promise to her many
things for to make her consent to him, but he
might never open the prison which was shut,
neither with key ne with axes, till he was ravished
with a devil, crying and treating himself, that
unnethe he escaped. And then she was drawn
out and set upon a wheel full of burning coals.
And the artillour, that was master of the torment,
had given a token to them to turn it, that when he
should make a sound, that they all should turn it,
and the fire should spring out and all to-break and
rend the body of the virgin3 but by the ordinance
of God the iron that the artillour and master had
in his hand, fell to the earth, and made the sound.
And they turned hastily so that the wheel burnt
the master of the work and kept Eufemia without
burt, sitting upon the wheel. And the parents of
the artillour wept and put the fire under the wheel,
and would have burnt Eufemia with the wheel,
but the wheel was burnt, and Eufemia was
unbounden by the angel of God, and was seen to
stand all whole, unhurt, in a high place. And
then Apulius said to the judge: The virtue of
christian people may not be overcome but by
iron, therefore I counsel thee to do smite off her
head. Then they set up ladders, and as one
would have set hand on her, he was anon smitten
with a palsy, and was borne thence half dead.
