THE GOLDEN LEGEND 221

this holy man Francis. And on a time as this The Life
holy man was in prayer, the devil called him thrice ⁰f 5· ,
by his own name, and when the holy man had Franms
answered him, he said: None in this world is so

great a sinner, but if he convert him our Lord
would pardon him, but who that slayeth himself

by hard penance shall never find mercy. And

anon this holy man knew by the revelation the
fallacy and deceit of the flend, how he would have
withdrawn him for to do well. And when the

devil saw that he might not prevail against him,

he tempted him by grievous temptation of the flesh,

and when this holy servant of God felt that, he
despoiled him of his clothes and beat himself right

hard with a hard cord, saying ε Thus, brother aSS,

it behoveth thee to remain and to be beaten3 and

when the temptation departed not, he went out

and plunged himself in the snow all naked, and

made seven great balls of snow and purposed to

have taken them into his body and said: This
greatest is thy wife, and of these four, two be thy
daughters, and two thy sons, and the other twain,

that one thy chamberer, and that other thy varlet

or yeoman3 haste thee and clothe them, for they

all die for cold, and if thy business that thou hast

about thern grieve thee sore, then serve our Lord
perfectly. And anon the devil departed from

them all confused, and S. Francis returned again

into his cell glorifying God.

And as he dwelled on a time with Leo the
cardinal of S. Cross, in a night the devils came to
him and beat him right grievously. Then he
called his fellow and said to him: These be devils,
jailers of our Lord, whom he sendeth to punish
the excesses, but I can remember me of none
offences that Ι have done, but by the mercy of God
