34 THE GOLDEN LEGEND ὲ
ἱ

The unbound and delivered. And then would have
Life Of presented to the apostle camels charged with gold ἵ
ὡὲίὸῐξέξᾶ and silver and precious stones, but he could not ᾗ
be found in no manner. And on the morrow}
following, the apostle appeared to the king, alone ¹
in his chamber, and said to him: Wherefore‘
soughtest thou me yesterday with gold and silver
and precious stones? Those things be necessary

it was convenable that he that overcame the son

virgin. He overcame him then mightily, when
he threw him puissantly out of his lordship which
had thrown out by force our forefather. And
thus, as he that overcometh some tyrant, sendeth
his fellows tofore for to set up his sign over all,
and to cast out tyrants, in like wise Jesu Christ

- sent his messengers over all for to take away the
honour and the worshipping of the devil right-

man by eating, and held him, that he should be
overcome by a man fasting, and hold man no
longer. For it is rightful that he which by the
art of the devil was despised, that by the art of
Jesu Christ he should be vanquished. And like as
the falcon taketh the bird, right so took he Jesu
Christ in desert because he fasted, and would
assay if he had hunger3 and if he had hunger,
that he might have deceived him by meat, and if
he had no hunger, then knew he well without doubt
