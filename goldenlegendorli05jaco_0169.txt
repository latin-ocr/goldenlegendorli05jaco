THE GOLDEN LEGEND 155

certainly this replenisher of the privy majesty

The Life

shone in his blessed face at the first to them that 0f S·

saw him, and he might by that sight and will draw
them to him. If such virtue, as men say, is in a
precious stone which is named magnet‚ which
draweth to him festues and straws, how much more
the creator of all things may draw to him whom
he will. This said Jerome. The second is his
largess or his liberality. For anon he made to
him a great feast in his house, the which was not
great by apparel of meats, but it was much great
only by reason of great desire, for he received
with right great will and right great desire. And
also it was great by reason of service, for this feast
was demonstrance of great mystery, which mystery
the gloss expoundeth upon S. Luke saying: He
that receiveth our Lord Jesu Christ in his house
was fed withinforth plenteously of greater things
than the other, that'is to wit of delectations, of
good manners, and of good delights. And after
he was great by reason of his enseignments, for he
showed great teachings and doctrines. And this
was of great mercy by desire, and not by sacrifice,
as he said : Misericordiam volo et non sacrificium,
etcetera. And also they that be whole need no
leech, and so it was great, for there was Jesu
Christ and his disciples. The third is humility
which appeared to him in two things, first he
showed him a publicari. The other evangelists, as
saith the gloss, because of shame, and for the
honour of the evangelist, they set not their common
name, but as it is written: The just is first accuser
of himself. And Matthew named himself publican,
first because that he showed that none converted
ought not mistrust of health, like as he was made of
a publican, an apostle and evangelist. Seeondly,

Matthew
