The Life
of S.
Remigius

210 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

together. And S. Remigius said: Nay, it shall
neither be mine nor thine‚ and anon the earth
opened and swallowed in all the mill.

And S. Remigius knew by the spirit of
prophecy and by the will of God, that a great
famine should come, and assembled in a town
great plenty of wheat. And the drunken villains
of the town mocked and scorned him of his
providence, and set the garners afire. And when
he knew it he came thither, and because he was
cold for age and his last time approached fast, he
sat down by the fire and warmed him, and said
with apeaceable heart: The fire is always good.
Nevertheless they that made that fire, and all the
men of their lineage, were broken in their members
and the women gouty. And this endured in the
same town unto the time of Charles, which chased
and made them go their way, and so disperpled
thern.

And it is to be known that the feast of S.
Remigius that is hallowed in J anuary, is the feast
of his blessed death and disposition, and this is
the feast of the translation of his blessed body.
For when, after his death, the holy body should
have been brought to the church of S. Timothy
and Apollinarius with the shrine, and came nigh
unto the church of S. Christopher‚ it began to
weigh so much that they might not move it from
thence in no manner. At the last they prayed
our Lord that he would vouchsafe to show them
if it were his will that the body should be buried
in that church, whereas no relies rest. And
then anon they took up the body lightly enough
and buried him there honourably. And many
miracles were there showed, so that they enlarged
and made the church more ample and large.
