222 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Life I have washed them away by satisfaction. But

of S.
Francis

peradventure he hath sent me them because he will
not suffer me to fall, because I dwell in the courts
of great lords, which thing peradventure engen-
dereth not good suspection to my right poor
brethren, which suppose I abound in delices.
And early in the morning he arose and departed
thence.

On a time, as he was in his prayerS, he saw upon
the covering of the house assemblies and companies
of devils which ran hither and thither with great
noise, and he went out, and signed him with the
sign of the cross, and said: I say to you in the
name of Almighty God that ye devils do to my
body all that is suffered to you to do, and I shall
suffer it patiently. For I have no greater enemy
than my body, and ye shall avenge me of mine
adversary, whiles ye take on it vengeance by my
life. Then they vanished away all confused.

There was a friar which was fellow of S. Francis
was on a time ravished, and saw in spirit the¹
glorious place in heaven, wherein he saw, among}
other seats, a right noble seat, shining of more noble
glory than all the others. And as he marvelled³
for whom this noble seat was kept, he heard that it
was said that this seat belonged sometime to one of
the princes that fell, and is now made ready to the
meek and humble Francis.

And when S. Francis issued from his prayers,
that friar demanded him: F ather, what weenest
thou of thyself ? And he said: I ween that I am
greatest *of all sinners. And anon the spirit came
into the heart of the friar and said: Behold what
was the vision that thou sawest, for humility shall
lift up the most meek man unto the seat lost by
pride.
