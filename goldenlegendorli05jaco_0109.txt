THE GOLDEN LEGEND 95

»f our Lord appeared to him, and laid a schedule The
[pon the altar where the sin of the king was ὲῑῖἓῗίἷ
vritten in by order, and that was pardoned him by · ¹ es
he prayers of S. Giles, so that he were ‘thereof
epentant and abstained him from doing it any

nore, and it was adjoined to the end that, who

hat required S. Giles for any sin that he had

lone, if he left it that it should be pardoned to

iim. And after the holy man delivered the
chedule to the king, and he confessed his sin and
‘equired pardon humbly.

Then S. Giles returned thence with honour,
ind when he came to the city of Nemausense, he
aised the son of a prince that was dead. And a*
ittle while after he denounced that his monastery
hould be destroyed of enemies of the faith. And
after he went to Rome and gat privileges of the
›ope to his ehurch, and two doors of cypress, in
vhich were the images of SS. Peter and Paul, and
ie threw them into the Tiber at Rome, and recom-
nended them to God for to govern. And when
1e returned to his monastery he made a lame man
,o go, and found the two doors of cypress at the
{ate of his monastery, whereof he thanked God
,hat had kept them without breaking in so many
[dventures as they had been, and sith he set them
tt the gates of the ehurch for the beauty of
hem, and for the grace that the ehurch of Rome
aad done thereto. And at the last our Lord
fhowed to him his departing out of this world, and
e said it to his brethren, and admonished them to
ray for him, and so he slept and died goodly in
ur Lord. And many witness that they heard
he company of angels bearing the soul of him into
ieaven. And he flourished about the year of our

ord seven hundred.
