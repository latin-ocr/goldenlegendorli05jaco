THE GOLDEN LEGEND 131

said to him: From whence comest thou? Thou The
hast slain some man. And he said: I have not. Exasta·
The christian man said: Verily‚ thou hast com· {hoenlf’lial
mitted some homicide, for thou art all besprongen (35053 y
with the blood. And the Jew said: Verily, the
God of christian men is great, and the faith of him
is firm and approved in all things 3 I have smitten
no man, but I have smitten the image of Jesu

In Syria, in the city of Beirout, there was a
christian man which had hired an house for a year,

image behind him. And it happed that a Jew
hired that same house, and on a day he bade

‘also threatened and menaced him because he durst
'keep in his house the image of Jesus of Nazareth3

he had never seen it, ne knew not that it was there,
and then the J ew seigned as he had been appeased,
and after, went straight to the prince of the Jews
and accused that J ew of that which he had seen in
his house. Then the Jews assembled and came to

the house of him and saw the image of Jesu Christ,
