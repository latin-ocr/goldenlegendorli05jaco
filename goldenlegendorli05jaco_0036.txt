The Life reputed sovereign of all, and he accounted himself l
Β 0f Sd least and most low. And at the last he confessedff
emar that when he was among his sovereign honours and
favours of the people, him seemed that there was
another man changed in him, or as he had been in
a dream. And there where he was among the
most simple brethren he used most amiable humility,‘
there he joyed, there round he himself, and thati
he was returned in to his own person. He was'
always found tofore the hours, or reading, or
writing, or in meditation, or in edifying his
brethren by word. On a time as he preached to
the people, and that they all understood devoutly
his words, such a temptation arose in his heart:
Verily, now preachest thou well, now art thou well
heard of the people, and art reputed wise ot them
all. And the holy man feeling him to be put in
this temptation‚ rested and tarried a while, and
thought whether he might say more or make an
end. And anon he was comforted by divine aid,
and answered softly to him that tempted him: I
neither began by thee, ne shall I end by thee3

and so performed surely all his sermon.
