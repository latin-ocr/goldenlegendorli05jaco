THE GOLDEN LEGEND 189

torment us. But they be in the air between The
heaven and earth, so that when they look upward Feast
they may behold the joy that they have lost, and gaf-{1²¹ a el

the which thing is in Genesis xxxii. chap.:
there where he saith that, the angel took the sinew
of Jacob, and anon it dried up. Thirdly‚ in
impressing in our hearts the memory of the passion
