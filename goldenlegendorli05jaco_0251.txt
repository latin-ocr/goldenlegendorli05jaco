THE GOLDEN LEGEND 237

Margaret, what harm did I ever to thee? Have I The
not adorned thee in all riches and in all glory? Llfe Οἵ
Ι pray thee tell me wherein I have angered thee, Sieffgssa'
and I shall amend it anon. I require thee, leave g
me not lest I be made reproaeh unto the christian
people. And then she blessed her and blew on
him, and the devil vanished away. And the third
day after, she assembled all the goods that she had
and gave it to the poor people for the love of God.
And a little while after she fied away by night,
without knowledge of any person, and took the
habit of a hermit and set herself in a little cell, and
there served our Lord in much great abstinence.
And was of much great and good renomee unto
all the people, and led a right holy life and good,
and was called brother Pelagien. After, a deacon
of the same bishop that had baptized her, went to
Jerusalem for to visit there the holy places. Then
that bishop said to him that, after the visitation of
the holy places he should seek a monk that was
named Pelagien‚ and that he should visit him, for
he should find there the true servant of our Lord,
and so he did. And anon she knew him, but he
knew her not for the great leanness that she had.
And Pelagien demanded him: Have ye a bishop?
And he said: Yea, lady. And she said to him:
Say to him that he pray for me, for truly he is
the apostle of Jesu Christ. And then the priest
departed and came again the third day, but when
he came he knocked at the door of the cell and
none answered, he opened the window and saw
that she was dead. Then he came and told it to
the bishop. Then the bishop and the clergy and
all the monks assembled for to do the exequies for
this holy man, and when they had taken the body
out of the cell, they found that she was a woman.
