*The of all filth and ordure. But I shall show him}
Llfe ⁰f to you that dwelleth therein tofore‚ to whom the ¹

S. Bar-
tholomew

apostle hath commanded to go in to desert. And
doubt ye not to see him, but make in your forehead
such a sign as I have graven in these stones. And
then he showed to them an Ethiopian more black
than thunder, the face sharp, the beard long, his
hairs hanging unto his feet, his eyes flaming as hot
fire, and cast out sparkles of fire, and casting out of
his mouth flames of sulphur, and his hands bound
with chains of fire behind his back. And then
the angel said to him: Because that thou hast
heard that the apostle hath commanded, and hast
broken all the idols of the temple, I shall unbind
thee3 goin to such a place whereas dwelleth no
man, and be thou there unto the day of judgment.
And when he was unbound he went his way with
a great braying and howfing, and the angel of our
Lord mounted up to heaven in the sight of thern
all. And then was the king baptized, with his
wife and his children and all his people, and left
his realm and was made disciple of the apostle.
Then all the bishops of the idols assembled
them together and went to Astrages the king, and
brother to Polemius, and complained of the loss of
their gods and of the destruction of their temples,

⁷ and of the conversion of his brother made by art

magic. Astrages was wroth and sent a thousand
men armed to take the apostle, and when he was
brought tofore him, the king said to him: Art
thou not he that hast perverted my brother ? And
the apostle answered to him: I have not perverted
him, but I have converted him3 and the king
said to him : Like as thou hast made my brother
forsake his god and believe in thy God, so shall I
make thee forsake thy God, and thou shalt sacrifice
