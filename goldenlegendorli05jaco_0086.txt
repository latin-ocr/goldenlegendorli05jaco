72 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The when his disciples had borne his body in to the,1
DePO-lla· city Se'basten of Palestine, they buried it between]
5¹:305th Elisoeum and Abdias, and at his tomb manyr

’Baptisffi miracles were showed. Then Julian the apostate1
commanded that his bones should be burnt, and]
they ceased not to do their woodness then3 they1
took them and burnt them into powder and!
winnowed them in the fields. And Bede saith}
in his Chronicles'that when they had gathered his«
bones they drew thern afar that one from that1
other, and by this wise he suffered the seconds
martyrdom. But they say that know it not, that}
the day of his nativity his bones were gathered alh
about and were burnt. And whiles they werea
ingathering‚ as it is said in Scholastica Historia‚‹
there came monks from Jerusalem which covertly:
put them among the gatherers, and took a greati
part of them and bare them to Philip, bishop of 1
Jerusalem. And he sent them afterwards ποι
Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, and long time«
after Theophilus, bishop of the same city, laich
them in the temple of Serapis, when he had*
hallowed and purged it from filth, and sacred it al
church in the honour of S. John Baptist, and thisi
is that the History Scholastic saith. But nowl
they be worshipped devoutly at Genoa, like as!
Alexander the third, and Innocent the fourth, ,ι
witnesseth for truth‚ and approve it by their :l
privileges. And like as Herod which beheadedl
him was punished for his trespass, so Julian the]¹
apostate was smitten with divine vengeance oft
God, whose persecution is contained in thel
history of S. Julian tofore rehearsed *after the
Conversion of S. Paul. Of this Julian the apostate,
of his nativity, of his empire, of his cruelty andr
of his death, is said plainly in Historia Tripartita.
