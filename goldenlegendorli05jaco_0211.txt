THE GOLDEN LEGEND 197

oi our souls tofore God, and this representation is The
in three n1a11nerS.First,they represent our FeaSt
prayers tofore God, and this saith Tobit the Mishael
xii. chapter. When thou prayedest with tears and
buryedest the dead men, Ι offered thy prayer
to our Lord. Secondly, they allege for us tofore
our Lord, and hereof saith J ob the xxxiii. chapter.
If there were an angel speaking for him and said,
one of a thousand, that he show the equity of the
man, our Lord should have mercy and pity on
him. Also Zechariah primo. And the angel of
our Lord answered and said: Ο Lord of all
strengthS, shalt not thou have pity of Jerusalem
and of the cities of J udah to whom thou art wroth?
This is the seventieth year. Thirdly, they show
the sentence of God, as it is said in Daniel that
the angel Gabriel flying said: Sith the beginning
of the prayers the word issued out, that is to wit,
the sentence of God, and I arn come foi> to show
it to thee, for thou art a man of desires. Of these
three things saith Bernard upon the CanticleS.
The angel seeketh moyen between the love and
the lover in offering the desires and bringing
gifts, and moveth her and pleaseth him. Sixthly,
they ought to be honoured, for they be the right
noble knights of the king perdurable, after that
Job saith in the twenty-fifth chapter: Is not this
the noble number of his knights? For as we see
in the knights of some king, that some of them
dwell always in the hall of the king, and accom-
pany the king, and sing honour and solace to the
king, and some others keep the cities and castles
of the king, and others fight against the enemies
of the king, thus is it of the knights of Christ.
Some be in the hall royal, that is to say in the
heaven imperial, and accompany always the king
