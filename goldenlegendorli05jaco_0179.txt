THE GOLDEN LEGEND 165

it thither. Peter of Amiens rehearseth that in The Life
Burgundy was a proud clerk and ambitious 0f 5,·
which had gotten a church of S. Maurice, Ju⁵t¹na
and usurped it by force against a mighty knight¹ . ts
which was contrary and against him. And on Ἄ ³
{a time was sung a mass in the end of the gospel,
{that they that enhance them shall be meeked‚
land they that meek them shall be enhanced. This
said malerous and cursed clerk laughed and said:
That is false, for if Ι had humbled and meeked
myself I had not had this day so much riches as I '
have in the church. And as soon as he had said
that, anon came thunder and lightning from heaven
in manner of a sword, and entered into his mouth
out of which issued the blasphemies, and anon he
was extinct and died suddenly. Then let us de-
voutly beseech Almighty God that by the merits
of this holy martyr S. Maurice and his holy fellow-
ship the legion, which is six thousand six hundred
and sixty-six, that suffered martyrdom, as hereto-
fore is rehearsed, we may after this transitory life
come unto the everlasting bliss in heaven, where he
reigneth‚ world without end. Amen.

Here fhlloweth the Life qf S. Justina, and first

of her name.

Justina is said of justice, for by justice she
rendered to every each that was his: that is to
wit, to God obedience3 unto her superior prelate,
reverence3 to her like and semblable, concord3 to
them that were beneath and inferior, discipline; to
her enemies, patience3 unto wretches and to them
in distress, compassion and works of pity; and
to herself, holiness.
