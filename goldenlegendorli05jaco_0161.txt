should have issued out of the pit, he was ravished ‘1³21ssoe rt

his people sought him long, and unnethe found
they a little of his bones with his clothes of silk
and his ouches of gold. And then the judge ate
himself for madness‚ and so was found dead
wretchedly. And Eufemia was buried in
Chalcedonia, and by her merits all the Jews
and paynims of Chalcedonia believed in Jesu
Christ. And she suffered death about the year
of our Lord two hundred and eighty. And S.
Ambrose saith of this virgin thus: The holy
virgin, triumphant in virginity, retaining the mitre,
deserved to be clad with the crown, by whose
merits the wicked enemy is vanquished, and
Priscus, her adversary and judge, is overcome.
The virgin is saved from the furnace of fire, hard
stones be converted into powder, wild beasts be
made meek and tame, and incline down their
necks, and all manner of pains and torments by
her orations and prayers be overcome. And at
the last, smitten with a sword, she left the cloister
of her fiesh, and is joined to the celestial company,
glad and joyous. And, blessed Lord, this blessed
virgin commendeth to thee thy church, and, good
Lord, let her pray to thee for us sinners, and this
virgin, without corruption flourishing, get unto us
that our desires may be granted of thee.
