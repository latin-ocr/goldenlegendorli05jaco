190 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The of our Lord, this is signified Apocalypsis v11.,
Fefast where it is said: Ne will ye not grieve ne noye
Μίἓὴεξὶ in the earth ne in the sea, ne the trees, till we

Mount of Olivet, and when he shall be in a
pavilion, in his siege, entered into that place where
our Lord ascended, Michael shall come and shall
slay him. Of which victory is understood, after

out of heaven, and of the battle that he had with
the devils that torment us. And of this last

the said place in the Mount Gargan was dedicate
and hallowed of him by revelation. For when
they of Syponte were returned from the occision

of their adversaries, and had so noble victory, yet
