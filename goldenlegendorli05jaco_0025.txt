which things the priest told to the lord. And so
it was granted to S. Rocke to abide there alone
three days. And in the end of the third day the
angel of God came to S. Rocke, saying thus: O
Rocke, God sendeth me for thy soul, of whom in
this last part of thy life that what thou now
desirest thou shouldest now ask and demand.
Then S. Rocke prayed unto Almighty God with
his most devout prayer, that all good christian men
which reverently prayed in the name of Jesu to
the blessed Rocke might be delivered surely from
the stroke of pestilence. And this prayer so made,
he expired and gave up the ghost.

Anon an angel brought from heaven a table
divinely written with letters of gold into the
prison, which he laid under the head of S. Rocke.
And in that table was written that God had
granted to him his prayer, that is to wit, that who
that calleth meekly to S. Rocke he shall not be
hurt with any hurt of pestilence. And then after
the third day the lord of the city sent to the prison
that S. Rocke should be delivered out of it. And
they that came to the prison found S. Rocke
departed from this life, and saw through all the
prison a marvellous light, in such wise that without
doubt they believed him to be the friend of God.
And there was at his head a great taper burning,
and another at his feet, by which tapers all his
body was light. Furthermore, they found under
his head the foresaid table, by which they knew
the name of the blessed Rocke by authority, which
name known, the mother of the lord of that city

S. Rocke
