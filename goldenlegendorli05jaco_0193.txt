THE GOLDEN LEGEND 179

And the angel said: This man hath done good
works to his neighbours. And the adversary
said: It sufficeth not but if he hath loved them as
himself. To whom the angel said: The fruit of
love is to do well, for God shall reward every
man after his works· And the enemy said:
Because he hath not fulfilled the words of love he
shall be damned. Then the devils fighting were
overcome of the angels‚ and yet the devil said : If
God be not wicked, this man shall not escape
without pain, for he promised to renounce and
forsake the world, and he hath not done it. Then
the angel answered: He loved not those things
that be of the world, but he loved well to dispend
them unto them that had need. And the devil
answered : In whatsomever manner he loved them
it was against the commandment of God. And
these adversaries thus vanquished, yet the devil
began again malicious accusations, saying: It is
written: If thou show not to the wicked man his
wickedness‚ Ι shall require his blood of thine hand,
and this man hath not showed worthily penance
to the sinners. And the angel said: When the
sinners despise the word that they hear, then the
tongue of the doctor is letted to speak. When he
seeth that his predication is heard and despised‚
then it appertaineth well to a wise man to be still,
when it is no time to speak. And this battle was
right strong, so much that they came tofore the
angel of God, and that the good had overcome
the adversaries. Then this holy man was
environed with great clearness, and as Bede saith,
one of the angels said to him: Behold the world.
