182 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The year of our Lord three hundred and ninety, was in
Feast the same city of Syponte a man which was named
.οὲ S‘l Garganus, which, after some books, had taken that

Mle ae name of the mountain, or else the mountain took

arrow at him. And anon the arrow returned
with the wind and smote him that had shot it,

this thing, and went to the bishop and inquired of
him what was to be done in this thing, that was so

demonstrance and showing of this thing. And
then anon the bishop and they of the city went
with procession unto that place, and durst not
enter into it, but made their prayers withoutforth.

named Tumba, by the seaside, six miles from the
