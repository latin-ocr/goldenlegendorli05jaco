196 ” THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The others, by whom when holy church is governed,
Feast all they that be chosen be judged, and these be
Μίἒιξᾶῗὶ with the thrones, and be they that with the charity
and love of God and their neighbour before others
be full, and these by their merits have taken
their sort in the number of cherubim, for cheru-

and all that ever they touch in any manner by word,
they make them anon to burn in the love of God.

angel which shall make ready thy way tofore thy
face. Secondly, in bearing them to heaven by
the way made ready, like as it is said in Exodus
the four and twentieth chapter : I send to thee mine
angel which shall keep thee in thy way, and shall
bring thee to the land which I have promised to
thy fathers. Thirdly, in setting them in heaven,
and hereof saith Luke, cap. xvi. It was done
when the beggar died, his soul was borne of
angels into Abraham's bosom. Fifthly, they
ought to be honoured because they be representers
