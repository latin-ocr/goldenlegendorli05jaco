114 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

 

Natalie: Adrian is delivered, see, lo! where he
cometh. And when she heard it she believed it
not, and said: And who may deliver him from!
his bonds? God forbid that he be loosed of his

the people of the felons, and without God‚ had
been offered to God, and how unhappy and how
caitiff am I! What shall I do that am joined to}
