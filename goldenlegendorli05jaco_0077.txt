THE GOLDEN LEc-END 63

Augustin knew not. S. Jerome saith thus in an The
epistle that he wrote to the glorious S. Augustin: ¹⁴¹¹} 0f ,
I have no conning to answer to thy two great {ocaffm’
books, shining by all clearness of fair speaking,
and certainly this that I have said and have learned
by engine and conning, and drawn out of the
fountain of scripture, is by thee declared and set
forth, but I pray thy reverence thou suffer me a
little to praise thy engine, The blessed Isidore
wrote thus of him in the book of twelve doctors :
The glorious S. Augustin‚ bishop, flying by the
high mountains as an eagle, hath pronounced by
clear words many of the spaces of heaven, the
bounds of the lands, and the circle of the waters.
And after it appeareth what reverence and love
S. Jerome had to him in the epistles that he sent
to the holy father S. Augustin: I, Jerome,
honour alway thy blessedness by such honour as it
appertaineth to love our Lord Jesu Christ dwell-
ing in thee. But and if it may be, let us now
gather of thy praisings something. The blessed
S. Gregory saith thus of his books in an epistle
:hat he sent unto Innocent‚ provost of Africa:
Because it hath liked to thee to send to us for the
exposition of holy J ob, we rejoice us in thy study.
But if thou wilt be made fat in scie‘nce, read the .
'sweet epistles of thy patron and head S. Augustin
bur fellow, but think not that our wheat may be
'pompared to his rye. And the blessed Prosper saith

f him: S. Augustin was quick in engine, sweet

n speech, wise in letters, and a noble worker in
·he labours of the church3 clear in daily dis-
·utations, in all his doings well ordered, sharp in
ssoiling questions, right appert in confounding
eretics, and right catholic in expounding of our
aith, and subtle in expounding the canon of scripture.
