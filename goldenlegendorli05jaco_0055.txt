. ute that he gat no remembrance to them that
dored him, and the maid that was lunatic by
:orment of the devil he did unbind and delivered
her all whole to her father. Oh, how great was
his misaele of holiness, when he made the fiend,
nemy to the lineage human, to break and destroy
is own idol, and to bring it to nought. Oh, how
orthy is he to be numbered to the heavenly
company to whom the angel appeared, to praise
the faith of him by his miracles, and came from
the sovereign hall and showed to all the people the
evil chained, and right foul, and the sign of
the cross impressed in the stone bearing health.
And the king and the queen were baptized, with
the people of their cities. And at the last the
tyrant brother of Polemius, new in faith by the
relation of the bishops of the temple, made the
blessed apostle, constant in the faith, to be beaten,
ayed, and receive right foul death. And as he
enounced the mischief of death, he had and bare

glorious strife.

preached first in Licaonia, and after in India, and
at the last in Alban, a city of great Armenia, and

he heard how our Lord said to him: Go, my
disciple, to preach, void out of this country, and go
fight and be capax of perils. Ι have first accom-
plished and finished the works of my father, and

o the temple where there was great company of The

*ick people without number, and made the devil so ἓξὲξ.
