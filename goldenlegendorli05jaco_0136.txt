demanded them where their daughter was become.

gods among the stars‚ and therefore her father
made an image of his daughter and commanded
that all the people should worship her. And she
dwelled among the company of brethren in the
dread of God3 and when the provost of the
church was dead, she was made provost. And
then in Alexandria was a lady noble and rich
which was named Melancia, whom S. Eugenia
anointed with oil and delivered her of a quartan‚
in the name of G0d‚ and she sent to her many
gifts which she would not receive. And the said
lady supposed that Eugenia had been a man, and
visited her oft and beheld the greatness and beauty
of her body, in such wise that she was strongly
esprised and chauffed in herlove, and was greatly

come and have pity on her, and when she was
come she told to her in what manner she was
taken in his love, and how she burned in desiring
him, and prayed her that she would lie by her and
have to do carnassy, and embraced her and kissed
her and exhorted her to do sin. And Eugenia
had great horror and abomination of her, and said:
Thou art by right called Melancia, for it is an evil
name and fulfilled of treason, thou art said black
